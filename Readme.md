# ERCF V2 RC2 mods list

While building and setting up my ERCF v2 kit I stumbled upon a few improvements in the available component designs that are aiming to improve multi material printing reliability.

This repo is an archive of my mods mostly so I don't loose the files :) 

## Mods Index

1. **G2E Filametrix Repository Clone:** Clone of IR Trails G2E repository for personal use and archiving.
2. **Galileo 2 Extruder Filametrix Mods:** Modified arm and Revo mount to improve strength and increase cutting arm travel, improving cutting reliability.
3. **Galileo 2 Extruder - Twinsor smoothed filament entry:** Smoothened entry from the reverse bowden to the extruder reducing the probability of the filament catching when entering the extruder. This is made for the lever switch version of the G2E filament sensor plate.
4. **Gantry Filametrix Depressor:** Slightly stronger gantry mount for the filament cutter.
5. **Pre-gate sensors ERCF V2 RC2:** Pre-gate sensors optimised for smooth retraction to aid endless spool operation together with the filamentalist.
6. **Gantry mounted nozzle brush:** Silicone nozzle brush plus a nozzle stop mounted on the gantry to aid with ooze reduction and nozzle cleaning.
7. **Double Shear Bearings for CL Labs CNC Parts:** Mod to enable double shear stepper support for A & B motors for Chaotic Lab CNC voron parts
