# Smoothed filament path for G2E dual filament sensor

This mod extends the work done by https://github.com/juliusjj25/G2E-Filametrix-Lever-Switch-Mod which is a based on https://github.com/IRTrail/G2E-Filametrix/tree/main

**Key changes:**
When using a 3mm ID/4mm OD PTFE tube the above designs have a slight lip which causes the filament to catch if it does not enter perfectly perpendicular to the extruder entry

This mod creates a funnel like shape smoothing out the filament entry to the extruder.

This repo only contains the modified front extruder body. For the remaining files please refer to the above sources.
