# Filament slot buffer

This is an extension to the popular slot buffer by Char (https://www.printables.com/model/639188-filament-buffer-for-350mm-vorons) which builds on the designs from:

 - https://www.printables.com/model/3793-fully-printable-prusa-mmu2-filament-retract-bank-b
 - https://www.printables.com/model/512077-filament-retract-bank-remix-for-voron-24-350mm

## Key changes:

1. Use magnet attachments for the Bowden tubes to the filament buffer. I find that using a magnetic attachment helps a lot when you need to disconnect the Bowden tubes from the buffer and aid in easing filament loading and unloading. The idea and the ECAS to 10mmx3mm magnet STL were taken from here: https://github.com/geoffrey-young/pika-filament-buffer. Big props to Geoffrey for the design and idea!
2. The original version can successfully buffer around 1m of filament and is sized to fit on the side of a Voron 350 printer. However due to my setup I needed a bit higher capacity. So I've created an extension panel (middle panel) which should allow the buffer to cope with around 1.5m or so of filament.
