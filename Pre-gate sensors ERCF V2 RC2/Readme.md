# Integrated pre-gate sensor for ERCF V2 RC2

This mod introduces an integrated filament pre-gate sensor to the ERCF V2 RC2 C9 filament paths. This enables the reliable use of endless spool functionality without needing to use the ERCT buffer.

The file was provided by a Discord member and modified by me to smooth out the filament entry and clean up some CAD inaccuracies.

Uses the standard BOM switches and ball bearings.
